# Real-Time Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic implementation of the real-time presence dashboard, following OTP principles and best practices.

## Implementation Order and Rationale

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (presence_core)
1. **Application and Supervisor Structure**
   - Start with the supervision tree as it's the foundation of fault-tolerance
   - Implement top-level supervisor with one_for_one strategy for isolated failure handling

2. **User Presence GenServer**
   - Core business logic for tracking individual user state
   - Implements heartbeat mechanism and timeout handling
   - Trade-offs: One GenServer per user vs shared state
     - Chosen: One per user for isolation and scalability
     - Alternative: Shared state would reduce memory but increase contention

3. **Presence Registry (ETS)**
   - Fast lookup for user -> process mapping
   - Trade-offs: ETS vs process registry
     - Chosen: ETS for O(1) lookups and persistence options
     - Alternative: Process registry simpler but less flexible

### Phase 2: Storage Layer (presence_store)
4. **Storage Behavior Definition**
   - Abstract interface for multiple backends
   - Allows swapping storage without changing core logic

5. **ETS Adapter Implementation**
   - In-memory storage for development and small deployments
   - Foundation for Redis/PostgreSQL adapters later

### Phase 3: API Layer (presence_api)
6. **Cowboy HTTP/WebSocket Setup**
   - WebSocket for real-time bidirectional communication
   - HTTP endpoints for REST operations

7. **Authentication Middleware**
   - JWT validation for secure connections
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Phase 4: Administration (presence_admin)
8. **Metrics Collection**
   - Telemetry integration for system observability
   - Key metrics: active users, connection count, message rates

9. **Admin Endpoints**
   - Dashboard data aggregation
   - System health checks

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
10. **XMPP Integration**
    - Optional MongooseIM adapter for existing XMPP systems

11. **Prometheus Exporter**
    - Standardized metrics format for monitoring

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each module using EUnit
- Property-based tests for critical paths using PropEr
- Integration tests using Common Test
- Load testing with Tsung or similar

## Code Documentation Standards
Each module will include:
- Module-level documentation explaining purpose and design decisions
- Function-level documentation with:
  - Purpose and parameters
  - Return values and error cases
  - Time complexity where relevant
  - Trade-offs and alternatives considered

## Getting Started
Begin with task #1: Create base project structure and dependencies
